v1.0 -- This version is way, way too fast.  First change will be to slow speed by at least half.
wiring to the RasPiRobot V3 hat -- 8 AA rechargable Ni-MH batter pack:  red -> +V, black -> GND
With caster in back, right motor: red -> R:rightmost terminal, black -> R:leftmost terminal (when facing robot from the front / looking at the ultrasonic eyes)
                     left  motor: red -> L:leftmost terminal,  black -> L:rightmost terminal (yes the two motor wires are 'reversed' relative to each other)

v1.1 -- Slowed the forward speed to 33% of original speed.  Also reduced the random turn speed from 50% to 33%
issues -- ultrasonic sensor doesn't always detect obstacles especially when approaching at an angle.

v2.0 -- Put the ultrasonic sensor on a servo controlled by an Arduino.
The robot will move foward until sensing a distance < 50 and will then stop and go backwards
a small amount.  The Pi will then send the character '1' over USB serial to the Arduino, 
which will cause the Arduino to control the servo by sweeping left and then right.  While
sweeping the Arduino will send the servo coordinates over serial to the Pi, which will use the
data to determine if the sensor is sweeping left or right.  If sweeping left it will store the sensor
distances in a 'left' array, otherwise it will store distances in a 'right' array.  After the sweep the 
Pi will take the average of the left and right array disances.  Whichever average is greater means
the path either left or right is more free, and the robot will then turn slightly in this direction
and continue moving forward.
issues -- While moving forward the robot will fail to detect obstacles that it approaces at an angle.
Need to stop and do a periodic sweep every few seconds while moving forward.
